# What is a digital garden

## Literary Definition

A Digital Garden contains a bunch of Markdown files that can link back to each
other, creating little connections in the process that can then be seen through
a huge [[Docs/Network Graph]]. Your just made your own web of Markdown files.

## Humane definition

A Digital Garden stores all of your thoughts, ideas, recipes, notes which are
stored in such a manner that they are open to be explored by the world. A
digital garden stands on the intersection of a notebook and a blog, well, it
can function like both if you want it to be!
